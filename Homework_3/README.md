# Vectorial Product of Matrices

This homework consisted in the creation of a matrices product calculator, it takes two matrices already in the code, just to bring the example on the table, and computes, sequentially and concurrently the code, depending if -fopenmp flag is used while compiling.

It also provides you with a way to repeat the computation N times, just by modifying the variable REPEAT into the Makefile.
