# Vectorial Product of Matrices

This homework consisted in the creation of a matrices vectorial product calculator, it creates two matrices of dimensions defined by AROWS, BCOLS, and ACOLS_BROWS in the Makefile, with randomized integer values between 0 and 100, and computes, sequentially and concurrently the code, depending if -fopenmp flag is used while compiling.

It also provides you with a way to repeat the computation N times, just by modifying the variable REPEAT into the Makefile.
